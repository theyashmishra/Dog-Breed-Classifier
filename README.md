# Dog-Breed-Classifier

1:-This is a Deep learning Model which classifier Dog breeds into 10 categories(beagle, chihuahua, doberman,
french_bulldog, golden_retriever, malamute, pug, saint_bernard, scottish_deerhound,
tibetan_mastiff).

2:-This Model is build with the Resnet50 and CNN with the help of Keras and tensorflow library.

3:-It also Demonstrates Transfer Learning as we have included in-built ResNet Classifier.

4:-I have created this Model on kaggle platform as it provides much powerful GPU and also the data can be fetch easily from kaggle itself

5:-All the steps are logged and commented in the Notebook.
